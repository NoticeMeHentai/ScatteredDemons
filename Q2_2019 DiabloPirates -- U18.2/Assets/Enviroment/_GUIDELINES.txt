other that being part of the world as decoration or obstacle.

:: MORE INFO
- If needed instead of 'Architecture/' make a folder with the level name.
Ex: Enviroment/Level1_Beach/

- If two or more prefabs use the same assets use a correct name for the
prefab.
Ex: Table_Short.prefab Table_Large.prefab Their folder should be ../Table/

'Physical Materials' and 'General Materials' are here because
I couldn't find another place for them :(
